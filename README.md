# event_emitter

Welcome to the simulation sandbox. Running this code means you have adopted a Zen Development Process which automatically takes care of all your issues in your development.

The Object that inherits EventEmitter is your Dev Process and it handles these events in dev cycle -
1. module-written
2. runtime-bugs
3. compile-time-bugs
4. feature-request
5. pull-request
6. server-overload

It will perform certain actions whe these some events are occurred or emitted. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.4. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
